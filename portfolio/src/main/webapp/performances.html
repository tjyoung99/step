            <p>Above is a recording of the last rehearsal before my GMEA All State Symphonic band performance. Sadly There are no Youtube video of this performance, most likely because recording devices were prohibited in the performance hall. luckily someone caught a great recording of my favorite song from the concert during this rehearsal</p>

            <p>This is one of my favorite Halftime shows that I have done as a part of the Tennessee State University Aristocrat of Bands. This performance took place in Atlanta Georgia for the Honda Battle of the Bands which is an annual exhibition for many HBCU Bands.</p>

            <p>Above is my favorite halftime show from HighSchool. This took place my sophomore year, around when I recieved my nickname. Aside from the quality of this performance, what keeps it near and dear to my heart is the Performance that followed,which was my first experience of Tennessee State's AOB. I fell in love with their program instantly and after confirming that I could potentially go to school on a full ride band scholarship and that my intended major was available, I was ready to register. Now, 4 years later I am a Junior Here at TSU and I still praise the performance That brought me here.</p>

            <p>Above is my favorite symphonic performance from Highschool. Again from sophomore year, this performance was for the 2015 HBCU consortium which is an annual conference for collegiate band directors. This performance was an honor being that typically the opportunity would be given to a collegiate ensemble. It only goes to show how advanced my Highschool's band program was at the time</p>
