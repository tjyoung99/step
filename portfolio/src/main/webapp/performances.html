        <p>This is a playlist of recordings from the concert where I performed 
            with the Honor Band Of America.</p>

        <p>Above is a recording of the last rehearsal before my GMEA All State 
            Symphonic band performance. Sadly There are no Youtube videos of 
            this performance. This is most likely because recording devices 
            were prohibited in the performance hall. Luckily someone caught a 
            great recording of my favorite song from the concert during this 
            rehearsal.</p>

        <p>This is one of my favorite halftime shows that I have done as a part 
            of the Tennessee State University Aristocrat of Bands. This 
            performance took place in Atlanta, Georgia for the Honda Battle of 
            the Bands, which is an annual exhibition for many HBCU Bands.</p>

        <h3>Highschool Performances</h3>

        <p>Above is my favorite halftime show from HighSchool. This took place 
            my sophomore year, around when I recieved my nickname. Aside from 
            the quality of this performance, what keeps it near and dear to my 
            heart is the Performance that followed,which was my first 
            experience of Tennessee State's AOB. I fell in love with their 
            program instantly, and after confirming that I could potentially go 
            to school on a full ride band scholarship, and that my intended 
            major was available; I was ready to register. Now, 4 years later, I 
            am a Junior at TSU and I still praise the performance that brought 
            me here.</p>

        <p>Above is my favorite symphonic performance from Highschool. Again 
            from sophomore year, this performance was for the 2015 HBCU 
            consortium, which is an annual conference for collegiate band 
            directors. This performance was an honor being that typically the 
            opportunity would be given to a collegiate ensemble. It only goes 
            to show how advanced my highschool's band program was at the 
            time.<p>
