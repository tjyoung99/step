          <h3>2019 Google Engineering practicum Internship</h3>
          <img src ="images/google.jpg"/>
          <p>During my previous internship I joined a team called Dialogflow, 
              which was originally a third party platform based in Russia. 
              Dialogflow generated and now maintains an API for generating 
              chatbots for users. I Constructed 2 user data management systems 
              for this team last summer. The project involved retrieving user 
              data from a database then displaying and allowing it to be 
              modified in Google's admin tool. Doing so gave tech support a GUI 
              to view and change users roles, instead of having to use mySql to 
              directlymanipulate database schema.</p>
          <p>Aside from my main project, I designed a program that projects 
              Google’s Diversity in 30 years. This program returns necessary 
              hiring ratios to better diversify the company. I presented this 
              program to Head of Equity Engineering at Google, Demma 
              Rodriguez.<p>

          <h3>FedEx</h3>
          <img src ="images/fedex.jpg"/>
          <p>In the spring of 2020 I decided to trade in the retail part time 
              lifestyle for a more labor intensive warehouse job. I applied to 
              work at FedEx as the pay rate seemed phenomenal and the hours 
              fairly flexible. I should have known it was a trap when they 
              hired me so quickly after I applied...I suppose I didn't learn 
              from my lesson working at QuikTrip. The job started out well; 
              however, I noticed one of my managers was a bit bossy. A month 
              into the job, I was fed up with his poor leadership. I put in my 
              2 weeks notice to my skip manager, and before I could make it 
              another week... the same bossy manager disrespected me; so I 
              simply told him I wasn't returning the next day.</p>

          <h3>Calvin Klein</h3>
          <img src ="images/ck.jpg"/>
          <p>Calvin Klein was a great job all around.  It's only downside was 
              that it was a retail job, which I find boring. Even with it being 
              a retail job, It was a small store which made it more   
              tolerable.<p>

          <h3>quick trip</h3>
          <img src ="images/qt.jpg"/>
          <p>QuikTrip is a gas station/convenience store. It was the most labor 
              intensive retail job you could possibly imagine. There were no 
              break rooms or seats specifically to keep employees busy. You 
              could go from mopping the floor, to making a pizza, to governing 
              a transaction, to helping a customer at a gas pump, to making ice 
              cream for a family of 12, to cleaning restrooms, to sweeping the 
              parking lot, just to check your watch and realize that only 5 
              minutes have passed. This was when I first picked up on the idea 
              that if you get hired too quickly, the job is probably 
              undesirable. I figured this was the case as I applied for this 
              job at 2am, the night after I quit working at WNB; I got invited 
              for an interview at about 10am and was hired later that same day. 
              Now I will think twice about any company that hires me within 
              less than a day of processing.</p>

          <h3>Wings n' Burgers Factory</h3>
          <img src ="images/wnb.jpg"/>
          <p>WNB was a dream job for a high schooler who loved chicken wings  
              such as myself. They were (AND STILL ARE) the best wing spot in 
              Atlanta, had flexible hours, nice co-workers, 30 minute breaks, 
              and free meals for employees. Did I mention they were the best 
              wing spot in Atlanta, a city known for having great wing spots? 
              Okay, just making sure. Anyway, I seem to have bad luck with part 
              time jobs, and this is where it began. I had a coworker that my 
              boss called, “baby”. She had poor manners, but her looks seemed 
              to get her by. We were pretty close at first, but her rude and 
              disrespectful nature kept me distant. One day she came to work 20 
              minutes late and had the nerve  to yell at me about not being in 
              the front of the store to let her in right away. Later that day 
              she made a mistake at the register, blamed me for it, and forced 
              me to pay for a customer's food. I told my manager about the 
              situation that night, and she said that since she wasn’t present, 
              I was on my own. I quit on the spot.</p>

          <h3>Vector Cutco</h3>
          <img src ="images/cutco.jpg"/>
          <p>I don't know if you've noticed the pattern by now, but this list 
              is in reverse chronological order making this my first job. 
              Vector Cutco is a pyramid Scheme that involves employees going 
              through their contact list, referring friends to the company, 
              calling friends and family, and making appointments with them to 
              demo and sell from a catalog of very expensive cutlery. I didn’t 
              like the job because I am not a fan of selling products that I 
              wouldn’t buy myself. I felt that sales were being made out of 
              pity and not from genuine want to buy the product. I quit not 
              more than a week into the job.</p>
