                <p>For years growing up basketball was my sport of choice. I'm not sure why. I was not great at all and finally when I was old enough to realize that I was riding the bench I finally gave up the sport</p>

                <h3>Football</h3>
                <img src ="images/football.jpg"/>
                <p>I began playing football in middle school. Sadly, I began the tryouts for the middle school football team Three days late; so ofcourse, I didn't get picked. Out of spite I joined a local recreational football team. I played a more active role on the team; but once again, I was not good nor was the rest of the team, so as in basketball we lost almost every game. Ultimately, I was happy for the experience; but, after that season, I solely returned to the football field dressed in a marching band uniform while toting a sousaphone.</p>

                <h3>Golf</h3>
                <img src ="images/golf.jpg"/>
                <p>Finally a sport that I was good at. I began playing golf junior year of Highschool. Following in the foot steps of a previous leader in  the band program. I remember thinking that I was preparing for retirement in advanced so that when all of my friends were ready to retire and relax on golf courses I would finally have a sport that I could best them in. Talk about thinking ahead right? by senior yeaar I began taking the sport more seriosly investing $200 of not so easily earned money in private lessons. 3 lessons later I had yet to win a match  but I still managed to place top 20 in my county tournament. This was a huge achievment to me as it proved that no matter the task, with my work ethic, anything that I wanteed to build proficiency in was in reach</p>
